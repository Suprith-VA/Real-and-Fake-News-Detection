# Real and Fake News Detection

This project aims to detect real and fake news using machine learning and natural language processing techniques.

# Project Overview
In the era of information overload, the ability to discern true from false has become crucial. This project is an attempt to tackle the problem of fake news detection.

# Features
1. Data preprocessing: The project includes scripts for cleaning and preprocessing the news data.
2. Feature extraction: Techniques like TF-IDF and Bag of Words are used to extract features from the news articles.
3. Model training: Various machine learning models are trained and evaluated on the preprocessed data.

# Getting Started
# Prerequisites
    Python 3.7+
    Libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, nltk


# Usage
1. Run the preprocessing script to clean the data and extract features.
2. Train the model using the training script.
3. Evaluate the model using the evaluation script.
